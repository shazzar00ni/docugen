# Plan 01-01 - File Upload Component

- Implement a React UploadArea component with drag-and-drop support for MD/MDX uploads.
- Accept single files or folders and collect file references in state.
- Render a basic file list UI to preview uploaded items.
- Create a minimal integration point in the app shell (placeholder) for later wiring.
